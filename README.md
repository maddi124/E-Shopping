# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

# Description
For this week challenge, We were given a Starter code with a working Express.js API. The tasks was to configure it to sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The dotenv was to store sensitive data such as MySQL username, password and databases name. Insomina was used to test the GET POST PUT and DELETE routes of all categories, Products and Tags
